# What is Influencer Marketing?

> **Influencer Marketing**: A type of social media marketing that uses endorsements and product mentions from influencers

*Who are influencers?* Someone who has:

* Power to affect the purchasing decisions of others because of his or her authority, knowledge, position, or relationship with his or her audience
* A following in a distinct niche, with whom he or she actively engages

*Types of influencers*:

* How niche they are: products / target audience 
* How large there reach is: mega, macro, micro, nano

# The Influencer Market: Stylized Facts 


* **Large and growing**, approx 9.7 billion USD in 2020
  * 2016: 1.7 billion USD, 2025: (expected) > 20 billion USD

* **Approx. 3/4 companies use influencer marketing** to some extent, mainly Instagram
  * **Only 65%** of those who use it, **track ROI**

* Becoming 'centralized' through influencer marketing agencies 
  * Interesting incentive problems here...

* Large **growth in the use of "micro" influencers** 

* Growing concern: **compliance issues**
  * Only approx 20% of (US/UK) posts meet regulatory guidelines

# Motivation

**Strategic Question**: How do an influencer's impressions vary with follower counts? 

**Why relevant?**

* Influencers typically paid according to follower base
* Different types $\rightarrow$ different effects
  * Mega: awareness 
  * Micro: consideration, intent, purchase 

**Application**: TikTok's Discover page

* "trending content" for > 200 hashtags
* Over six months

.center[Want a **non-linear** relationship between followers and impressions]

`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` How would you go about answering the problem?
`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` What would be your "ideal experiment?"



---
class:font150
# The Authors' "Ideal" Experiment 

Imagine a **company knows the type of influencer** they want to hire

<br>

* Suppose **many "identical" influencers** of this type, but **vary only by followers count** 

* Could **collaborate with each at different points in time**

* Measure the **effect of followers on impressions** 

* This **traces out the relationship** they're interested in

<br>

`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")`Is this *really* the optimal experiemnt?

---
class:font160
# What the authors actually do 

The thought experiment that underpins their analysis: 

* **Many potential influencers** company can collaborate with
  * Who **create similar content**, match desired "influencer profile"
  * **Vary in follower counts** 

* Assume the "exchangability" of influencers 


`r icons::fontawesome("rocket", style = "solid")`If company paid for more followers, would campaign metrics have differed?

# Collecting Data from Posts

`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` How to get data from posts?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/tiktok_posts.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` Why do they need this?

---
class: font150
# Collecting Data from Posts

**Answer 1**: Machine learning

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
url <- "figs/tiktok_ml_posts.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Extracts the "data":

* Text 
* Image 
* Audio 
* Editing style

**Answer 2**: In class...

class: font150
# Estimating Follower Elasticities 

**Estimating equation**:

$$log(Impressions_j) = g(log(Followers_{ij}), ControlVariables_j) + e_j$$

**Challenge**:

* Follower counts likely correlated with unobservables (in the $e_j$)

$\implies$ need some extra work to claim causality 

**Solution**: "An extra modelling equation"

* Explains $log(Followers_{ij})$ via likes of *similar* content creators 

<br>

.font70[**Remark**: This won't be in the exam ... it's quite subtle]

# Main Result


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/tiktok_avg_fei.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Key Takeaways**: 

* U-shaped
* Largest follower elasticity at 6,500 followers
* Similar magnitudes* to advertising effectiveness

# Role of Engagement Tactics


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/tiktok_engagement_tactics.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Key Takeaways**: 

* Less than 10K followers: informative content leads to more impressions 
* Large follower base: "socializing" content leads to more impressions
  * Though less effective *on average*
* Entertaining content similar effect as informational

# Influencer Type Counterfactuals

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/tiktok_counterfactuals.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```
]
.pull-right[
**S-shaped**: "Special Effects" focussed campaign

* Only catches on if popular enough influencer posts it

<br>

**Concave**: Product Demonstration focussed campaign

* Niche audiences for this content

<br>

**Linear**: Self Expression focussed campaign 

* Broad appeal to all audiences
* This is the most frequent in the data
]

# Optimal Influencer Selection

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/tiktok_optimal_influencer.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Assume value/impression and cost per 1K followers 

$\rightarrow$ optimal number of followers for a campaign

---
class: font150
# Takeaways

* If campaign focused around "social content" and socialization: influencers with a higher follower count

* If campaign focused around information: lower follower counts 
  * Why? Trust and authenticity

* Once we can quantify elasticity of impressions with respect to followers, we can establish the optimal follower count to target for a new campaign
  * Conditional on knowing cost per followers *and* assuming value generated per impression

class: font160
# Motivation

**Strategic Question**: What is the effectiveness of influencer marketing on consumer demand? 

**Why relevant?**

* (Over-) Excitement about influencer marketing 
* Limited evidence beyond anecdotes 
* It's **hard** to do, but **worth** trying

**Methods**:

* No experiment but **clever empirical strategy**  
* $\implies$ think of most estimates as **causal**

**Application**: Twitch & Video Games

# What we want to know 


.center[How **Viewership of streams impacts demand**]

`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` Why won't linear regression suffice?


---
class: font160
# The Key Idea of the Paper 

.font120[*Ideal Experiment*]:

**Activate streamers** at **random times** to generate **exogenous variation** in **viewers** 

.font120[*Paper's "best" approximation*]:

* Variation in timing of when top streamers broadcast
* ... that should be independent of shocks to game popularity
* Essentially exploiting that streamers work "irregular" hours


---
class: font140
# Model Free Evidence

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_modelfree.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Observations:

* Players does not immediately peak 
* Slowly returns to baseline

$\implies$ potential for short-lived effects on game usage

---
class: font140
# Empirical Strategy

Regression Equation:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_regression.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

where: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="35%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_viewerstock.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

i.e. is a weighted sum of recent viewers ...

* where the eights decay geometrically, over time 
* Set T = 72 hours (!!)

$\delta$ $\rightarrow$ persistant effect of viewership 

* "carryover" relative to "immediate" effects

---
class: font140
# Empirical Strategy

**How to they use streamer's timing of broadcast?** 

* Technically: **instrumental variables**
* To overcome omitted variable bias and simultaneity
* See digram in class ... 

What are the instruments?

* **Number of top streamers broadcast game $j$ at time $t$**
  * Measure this for **each of the last 12 hours**


---
class: font140
# Main Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_main_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Findings: 

* **Small**, positive & statistically significant effects $\rightarrow$ $\beta$
  * Interpret!
* Effect **persists over time** $\rightarrow$ $\delta$

---
class: font140
# Heterogeneity Across Products

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="45%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_heterog.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Largest Effects: 

* **Small** publishers 
* **High variance** in ratings 
* **Older** games  

---
class: font140
# Sponsored Versus Organic 


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_sponsored.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

$\omega < 1$ $\rightarrow$ **sponsored content** effectiveness is a fraction of organic 

* **15.7% as effective as organic streams!**

---
class: font140
# Cascades 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_cascades.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Cascades: sponsored stream generates additional organic content

---
class: font140
# Cascades 

Suppose a top streamer is sponsored to broadast:

* **Directly increases viewership** by $\hat{\theta}_1$
* **Induces** an additional $\hat{\theta}_1 \hat{\gamma}$ to **organic broadcasters** 
* Which **generates**  $\hat{\theta}_1 \hat{\gamma} \times \hat{\theta_2}$ **more viewers**
* ...

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_cascades_totaleffect.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

*End result* (Viewers): 

* Induces approx. 3 organic streams 
* Which is 2.6 times as many viewers than sponsored stream

*End result* (Sales):

* 1.6 sales per 1000 viewers

# Return on Investment (ROI)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_roi_formula.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_roi.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Median game has additional revenue of $19.50 due to sponsored streams
  * Median ROI = -86%
* 15% of games have positive ROI if **not** account for cascades 
* 27% of games have positive ROI if account for cascades 

$\implies$ **sponsored influencer promotions are mostly ineffective**

---
class: font160
# Takeaways 

* **Small, positive effects** of organic influencer content **on demand** 
  * Similar in magnitude to OWoM volume and advertising 
  * ... which helps these numbers feel credible 
* **Sponsoring influencers** leads even **smaller effects** (approx 1/5th!)
  * But does lead to cascades of organic content 
* **ROI** for sponsored content is **negative for 2/3rds of games**

# What is the effect of sponsorship disclosure on influencers?

---
class: font160
# Motivation 

**Strategic Question**: How does sponsorship disclosure impact consumer evaluations of brands and influencers?

* And does it differ across influencer type?

**Why Relevant?**

* Sponsored influencer posts used to be the "wild west" of advertising
  * i.e. unregulated, left to consumers to discern 
  * Unlike most advertising markets
* Increase regulation mandated by governments ...
* ... But actual uptake is still low

```

We're off to the (online) lab to get at these answers 

* Discussion Q: Why?

---
class: font140
# Experiments: An Overview

**Study 1a**: Influencer Type on persuasion knowledge? What are the impacts on brand eval and likeability?

**Study 1b**: Replicates Study 1a with "more control"

* Less info about influencer changing simultaneously
* (Won't discuss this here)

**Study 2**: What does disclosure vs non disclosure do? 

**Study 3**: Replicates Study 2 with real influencers
* (Won't discuss this here)

---
class: font150
# Study 1a

The Basics: 

* **Fictitious** influencers 

* Influencer **Types**: Nano, micro, macro, mega, nano

* Industry: **Food, Instagram** 

* Participants: 282 **Western Europeans** 

---
class: font130
# Study 1a: Stimuli

Varies **Profile info** across types of influencer 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/disclosure_study_1_manip1.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Varies **likes** across types of influencer 


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/disclosure_study_1_manip2.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Study 1a: Results 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="55%"}
url <- "figs/disclosure_study_1_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Takeaways: 

* Mediation via persuasion knowledge for macro, mega, nano 
* No Mediation via trustworthiness of the post 

Persuasion Knowledge?

* Consumers expected post to be sponsored

$\implies$ when consumers think something is sponsored and can't be verified perceptions go down

---
# Study 2 

2 x 2 design: 

* nano vs mega 
* non-disclosure vs disclosure 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/disclosure_study_2_manip.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
class: font140
# Study 2: Results 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
url <- "figs/disclosure_study_2_results_fig.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* When no disclosure, when respondant thinks post is sponsored their trust in post content falls
  * Leads to lower evals of influencer and brand (not shown)
* **NOT** the case when sponsorship is disclosed

---
class: font160
# Takeaways 

* Revealing a post is **sponsored** makes **consumers trust the post more**, particularly **when the content is perceived to be sponsored**

* ... **Prevents decrease in likeability of influencers** and **negative brand evaluations** 


---
class: inverse, center, middle
# Recap 

---
class: font160
# Summary

* Characteristics of an influencer and their content delivery are associated with their popular

* Organic influencers have small, positive effect on demand

* Sponsored content appears to have negative ROI (on twitch, in gaming)
  * More work needed to generalize this

* Disclosing post is sponsored prevents negative association from consumers to influencer and brands 
  * What does it do to engagement and purchase intentions?
