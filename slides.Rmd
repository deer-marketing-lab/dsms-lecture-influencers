# What is Influencer Marketing?

> **Influencer Marketing**: A type of social media marketing that uses endorsements and product mentions from influencers

Who are influencers? Someone who has:

* Power to affect the purchasing decisions of others because of his or her authority, knowledge, position, or relationship with his or her audience
* A following in a distinct niche, with whom he or she actively engages

Types of influencers:

* How niche they are 
* How large there reach is: mega, macro, micro, nano

# The Influencer Market 

**Stylized Facts**:

* Large and growing, approx 9.7 billion USD in 2020
  * 2016: 1.7 billion USD, 2025: (expected) > 20 billion USD

* Approx. 3/4 companies use influencer marketing to some extent, mainly Instagram
  * Only 65% of those who use it, track ROI

* Becoming 'centralized' thorugh influencer marketing agencies 
  * Interesting incentive problems here...

* Large growth in the use of "micro" influencers 

* Growing concern: compliance issues
  * Only approx 20% of (US/UK) posts meet regulatory guidelines

# Characteristics of Popular Streamers

---
class: font160
# Motivation

**Strategic Question**: What are the key characteristics of popular streamers

* Streamers as an insight into influencers more generally ...

**Why relevant**:

* *Influencer*: Can you "become" more popular?
* *Firms*: What are characteristics of influencers that get high engagement?  

**Observational Study + no "clever" empirical strategy**

$\implies$ **Findings are descriptive**

url <- "figs/influencer_charac_hypotheses.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Affordance?** In this paper...

* Profile Information & social interactivity

... as **distinct from professionalism** ... 

* Part of a professional team & gaming proficiency

---
class: font160
# Data

516 Twitch streamers over three weeks

**Streamer Popularity** (static!): 

* View count
* Number of followers

**Social Interactivity**: 

* Webcam
* Words in Transcript 
* Links to Twitter Profile 

**Personality Traits**:  

* Linguistic Analyses of stream transcripts & tweets

.center[.font70[Note the lack of subscripts! Don't be **that** person!]]

Remarks:

* PBA: Profile Building Affordance 
* Same regression with no. of followers as alternative outcome

**Remark**: Mind the overly causal language in the results section of the paper

---
class: font160
# Takeaways

Having:

* Profile Descriptors 
* Camera On 
* Talking to your viewers 
* Being a Professional 

**positively associated** with being more **popular** on Twitch 

**Personality Trait** results are **mixed** ... 

* Openness and conscientiousness negative associated with popularity 
* Neuroticism positively associated

(**my** worries on this bit: Omitted Variables, measurement errors)

# Motivation

**Strategic Question**: What is the effectiveness of influencer marketing on consumer demand 

* Application: Twitch & Video Games 

**Why relevant?**

* (Over-) Excitement about influencer marketing 
* Limited evidence beyond anecdotes 
* It's **hard** to do, but **worth** trying

No experiment but **clever empirical strategy** 

$\implies$ think of most estimates as **casual**

# The Key Idea of the Paper 

.font120[*What they want to estimate*]: 

**Viewership of streams** $\rightarrow$ **demand**

* Question: Why won't linear regression suffice?

.font120[*Ideal Experiment*]:

**Activate streamers** at **random times** to generate **exogenous variation** in **viewers** 

.font120[*Paper's "best" approximation*]:

* Variation in timing of when top streamers broadcast
* ... that should be independent of shocks to game popularity
* Essentially exploiting that streamers work "irregular" hours


---
class: font140
# Model Free Evidence

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_modelfree.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Observations:

* Players does not immediately peak 
* Slowly returns to baseline

$\implies$ potential for short-lived effects on game usage

---
class: font140
# Empirical Strategy

Regression Equation:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_regression.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

where: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="35%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_viewerstock.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

i.e. is a weighted sum of recent viewers ...

* where the eights decay geometrically, over time 
* Set T = 72 hours (!!)

$\delta$ $\rightarrow$ persistant effect of viewership 

* "carryover" relative to "immediate" effects

---
class: font140
# Empirical Strategy

**How to they use streamer's timing of broadcast?** 

* Technically: **instrumental variables**
* To overcome omitted variable bias and simultaneity
* See digram in class ... 

What are the instruments?

* **Number of top streamers broadcast game $j$ at time $t$**
  * Measure this for **each of the last 12 hours**


---
class: font140
# Main Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_main_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Findings: 

* **Small**, positive & statistically significant effects ($\beta$)
  * Interpret? 
* Effect **persists over time** ($\delta$)

---
class: font140
# Heterogeneity Across Products

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_heterog.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Largest Effects: 

* Small publishers 
* High variance in ratings 
* Older games  

---
class: font140
# Sponsored Versus Organic 


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_sponsored.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

$\omega < 1$ $\rightarrow$ sponsored content effectiveness is a fraction of organic 

* 19.7% as effective as organic streams!

---
class: font140
# Cascades 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_cascades.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Cascades: sponsored stream generates additional organic content

---
class: font140
# Cascades 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_cascades_totaleffect.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Sponsored streams generate 6.1 streamers to broadcase organically 
  * $\theta_1 \gamma / (1 - \theta_2 \gamma)$
* Additional organic streams generate 15,235 new viewers 
  * ... which are more likely to convert to buyers

---
# Return on Investment

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/video_ads_roi.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

ROI:

* Median game has additional revenue of $9.5 due to sponsored streams
* 18% of games have positive ROI if **not** account for cascades 
* 34% of games have positive ROI if account for cascades 

$\implies$ **sponsored influencer promotions are mostly ineffective**

---
class: font160
# Takeaways 

* **Small, positive effects** of organic influencer content **on demand** 
  * Similar in magnitude to OWoM volume and advertising 
  * ... which helps these numbers feel credible 
* **Sponsoring influencers** leads even **smaller effects** (approx 1/5th!)
  * But does lead to cascades of organic content 
* **ROI** for sponsored content is **negative for 2/3rds of games**

# Sponsorship Disclosure of Influencers 

---
class: font160
# Motivation 

**Strategic Question**: How does sponsorship disclosure impact consumer evaluations of brands and influencers?

* And does it differ across influencer type?

**Why Relevant?**

* Sponsored influencer posts used to be the "wild west" of advertising
  * i.e. unregulated, left to consumers to discern 
  * Unlike most advertising markets
* Increase regulation mandated by governments ...
* ... But actual uptake is still low

# Conceptual Framework

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/disclosure_conceptual.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

We're off to the (online) lab to get at these answers 

* Discussion Q: Why?

---
class: font140
# Experiments: An Overview

**Study 1a**: Influencer Type on persuasion knowledge? What are the impacts on brand eval and likeability?

**Study 1b**: Replicates Study 1a with "more control"

* Less info about influencer changing simultaneously
* (Won't discuss this here)

**Study 2**: What does disclosure vs non disclosure do? 

**Study 3**: Replicates Study 2 with real influencers
* (Won't discuss this here)

---
class: font150
# Study 1a

The Basics: 

* **Fictitious** influencers 

* Influencer **Types**: Nano, micro, macro, mega, nano

* Industry: **Food, Instagram** 

* Participants: 282 **Western Europeans** 

---
class: font130
# Study 1a: Stimuli

Varies **Profile info** across types of influencer 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/disclosure_study_1_manip1.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Varies **likes** across types of influencer 


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/disclosure_study_1_manip2.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Study 1a: Results 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="55%"}
url <- "figs/disclosure_study_1_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Takeaways: 

* Mediation via persuasion knowledge for macro, mega, nano 
* No Mediation via trustworthiness of the post 

Persuasion Knowledge?

* Consumers expected post to be sponsored

$\implies$ when consumers think something is sponsored and can't be verified perceptions go down

---
# Study 2 

2 x 2 design: 

* nano vs mega 
* non-disclosure vs disclosure 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/disclosure_study_2_manip.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
class: font140
# Study 2: Results 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
url <- "figs/disclosure_study_2_results_fig.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* When no disclosure, when respondant thinks post is sponsored their trust in post content falls
  * Leads to lower evals of influencer and brand (not shown)
* **NOT** the case when sponsorship is disclosed

---
class: font160
# Takeaways 

* Revealing a post is **sponsored** makes **consumers trust the post more**, particularly **when the content is perceived to be sponsored**

* ... **Prevents decrease in likeability of influencers** and **negative brand evaluations**

# Recap 

---
class: font160
# Summary

* Characteristics of an influencer and their content delivery are associated with their popular

* Organic influencers have small, positive effect on demand

* Sponsored content appears to have negative ROI (on twitch, in gaming)
  * More work needed to generalize this

* Disclosing post is sponsored prevents negative association from consumers to influencer and brands 
  * What does it do to engagement and purchase intentions?
